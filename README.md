# OCI-Billing-Review-Api-Script
A Python script dedicated to inventorying resources with a financial cost on an OCI cloud tenant. I am not at all an expert on cloud computing and even less so for Oracle, so I apologize if I have missed any important resources. If this is the case, please do not hesitate to contact me or add them yourself.
